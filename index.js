// 1. SyntaxError: Unexpected token ';'
/*
Instructions:
    * Carefully examine the line of code where the error occurred.
    * Pay close attention to punctuation marks, especially semicolons, parentheses, and brackets.
    * Ensure that all statements are properly terminated and that function calls have matching parentheses.
    * Double-check for any missing or extra characters that might be disrupting the code's structure.
*/
let message = "Hello, World!";
console.log(message); // SyntaxError: Unexpected token ';'

// 2. ReferenceError: myVariable is not defined
/*
Instructions:
    * This error indicates that you're trying to use a variable that hasn't been declared.
    * Look for where the variable should have been declared using `let`, `const`, or `var`.
    * Verify the spelling of the variable name in both the declaration and the usage.
    * Ensure that the variable is declared before it's used.
*/
let myVariable = 20;
console.log(myVariable); // ReferenceError: myVariable is not defined

// 3. TypeError: greeting is not a function
/*
Instructions:
    * This error means you're attempting to call a value as if it were a function, but it's not.
    * Identify the value you're trying to call (in this case, `greeting`).
    * Determine the data type of that value.
    * Remember that only functions can be called using parentheses `()`.
    * If you need to use the variable greeting, then use it as a variable, not a function.
*/
const greeting = "Hello";
console.log(greeting); // TypeError: greeting is not a function

// 4. TypeError: Cannot read property 'property' of undefined
/*
Instructions:
    * This error occurs when you try to access a property of a variable that holds `undefined`.
    * Check the value of the variable (`obj` in this case) before accessing its properties.
    * Make sure the variable has been assigned an object before you attempt to access its properties.
    * If you expect the variable to hold an object, you may need to add code that assigns an object to the variable.
*/
let obj;
//console.log(obj.property); // TypeError: Cannot read property 'property' of undefined

// 5. Incorrect Object Concatenation
/*
Instructions:
    * When you try to concatenate an object with a string using the `+` operator, JavaScript converts the object to its default string representation, which is `[object Object]`.
    * If you want to display the object's properties, you need to access them individually.
    * Consider using template literals or `JSON.stringify()` to create a string representation of the object.
    * Remember that the console.log() function can take multiple arguments, and will display them all.
*/
const user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
};

//console.log("User info: " + user); // Output: User info: [object Object]

// 6. Casting Failure (Incorrect Type Conversion)
/*
Instructions:
    * JavaScript performs type coercion when you use the `+` operator with different data types.
    * In this case, it treats the number `5` as a string and concatenates it with the string `"10"`.
    * If you want to perform arithmetic addition, you need to ensure that both operands are numbers.
    * Use functions like `parseInt()` or `parseFloat()` to convert strings to numbers.
    * Be aware that if the string that is being converted to a number, is not a number, then the result will be NaN.
*/
let num = "10";
//console.log(num + 5); // "105"
